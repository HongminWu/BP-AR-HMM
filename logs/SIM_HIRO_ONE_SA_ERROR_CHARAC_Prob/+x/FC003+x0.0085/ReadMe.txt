FC003-x0.0085-NVARFP-10

This trial had as a goal a point 1mm ahead of trial FC002. Instead of having the male walls hit at about 20%
of their length from the front, they hit at about 33%.

The right side of the wall (looking from hiro's left side to right side) impacts at around 4.5secs,
The left side hits at around 5.6secs. But at this time, one of the walls on the right side of the wall penetrate the female snap. 

However, there does not seem to be a force record of this in the plots. One would expect that force to grow upon impact, but as it is felt as if nothing is there, the force drops. This fact, however, can tell us how the force profile may look like it something falls.

How does trial FC003 relate to FC002?
Up to 4.5 secs, the data looks the same. However, FC003 has further motion that FC002 did not elicit. 
- Fx: 0:4.5 Force increases when when motion begins. Towards 4.5 when motion slows down, less pressure felt. 4.5:5.5 Not sure about this response. 5:5-6:5, walls hit and feel increase in pressure in the vertical direction. 
- Fy: 0:4.5 No force felt through motion in air. 4.5:5.5 Right side of wall impacts and causes the change in motion. 5.5-6.5, the wrist is aligning but then there is a contact on the other side and force-becomes negative.
- Fz: 0:4.5 No force felt in the forward direction. 4.5:5.5 initial impact felt in the forward direction and force rises. 5.5-6.5 sliding takes place and force in the forward direction diminish until walls hit again around 6 secs and increase the pressure again. 
- Mx: 0:4.5 No force. 4.5:5.5 Some kind of alignment begins to increase force. 5.5:6.5. Strong alignment peaks the force.
- My: 0:4.5 No force. 4.5:5.5 contact against male wall makes wrist rotate some. 5.5:6.5 Sliding motion takes pressure away in this axis.
- Mz: 5.5-6.5 Strong alighment peaks the force.
