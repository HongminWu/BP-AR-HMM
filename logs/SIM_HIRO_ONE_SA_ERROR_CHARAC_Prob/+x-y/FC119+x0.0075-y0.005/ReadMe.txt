FC002b+x0.0075-y0.005-NVARFP-10-z0.531

Forces experienced here are stronger because our goal height position is set below the normal level. This is so, so that as we go further out in our testing, i.e. from x=0.0075 to 0.0085 to 0.0095, there is still some contact.

Force Axis:
x-points down
z-points forward

ConstratintForceSolver Parameters for No Penetration:
The value of NVARFP in ConstraintSolver.cpp (L77) is 10.0.
