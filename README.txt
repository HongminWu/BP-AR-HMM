1. This is based on software originally written by Emily Fox and Erik Sudderth (see below) and adapted for use in an LfD setting.
2. The main script to run is utilities/test.m
3. utilities/loadRobotLogs shows an example of how to load data. Basically,
 you want to create a struct that has the n-dimensional observations of each of your demonstrations.

This software package includes several Matlab scripts and
auxiliary functions, which implement MCMC sampling algorithms 
for the model described in the following publication:
  Sharing Features among Dynamical Systems with Beta Processes

Package Organization and Documentation
========================================================================

Summary of BP-AR-HMM package contents:

IBPHMMinference.m:
  Main inference script using the birth-death RJMCMC sampler for unique features.
IBPHMMinference_PoissonProp.m:
  Main inference script using Poisson proposal for unique features.
/utilities:  
  Script runstuff.m with example inputs to main inference script, along
  with various other functions used to create necessary structures, etc.
/relabeler:  
  Code to perform optimal mapping between true and estimated mode sequences.

========================================================================
Setup and Usage Examples
========================================================================

For an example of sparse feature extraction, see runstuff.m.
To use the BP-AR-HMM code, you must first take two steps:
1) Install Minka's lightspeed toolbox and add directory to path:
	http://research.microsoft.com/~minka/software/lightspeed/
2) Add /relabeler and /utilities directory to path
